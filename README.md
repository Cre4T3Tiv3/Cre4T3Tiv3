# Hi, I‚Äôm Jesse Moses (@Cre4T3Tiv3)

üéØ Full-stack and AI-native product builder<br>
üíª 10+ years of experience delivering scalable software across frontend, backend, and runtime systems<br>
üß† Advanced understanding of machine learning and LLM workflows<br>
üõ†Ô∏è Building OSS tools that combine great UX with deep engineering craft

I'm a software engineer who builds end-to-end AI products ‚Äî from clean UI to robust infrastructure. My background spans fintech, ad-tech, and enterprise SaaS, where I've delivered production-grade systems that merge deep backend architecture, rich frontend UX, and AI-native tooling.

My work includes full-stack web applications, API-first distributed systems, LLM apps, agentic runtimes, and ML-integrated pipelines. I specialize in building developer tools and runtime systems that are modular, maintainable, and grounded in real engineering principles.

I build in public and treat open-source like product. Clear abstractions, practical workflows, and thoughtful code are at the core of everything I release.

Committed to scalable engineering, cross-stack execution, and building tools that empower both humans and machines.
