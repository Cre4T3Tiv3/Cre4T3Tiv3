# Hi, I‚Äôm Jesse Moses (@Cre4T3Tiv3)

üéØ Full-stack and AI-native product builder  
üíª 10+ years delivering scalable software across frontend, backend, and runtime systems  
üß† Applied expertise in LLM integration, agentic workflows, and modern AI tools  
üõ†Ô∏è Building OSS projects that combine clean UX with solid engineering fundamentals

I build complete AI products, from frontend design to runtime orchestration. With a background spanning fintech, ad-tech, and enterprise SaaS, I design and ship real-world systems that are powerful, usable, and grounded in developer experience.

My work includes full-stack web apps, API-first distributed systems, LLM tools, agentic runtimes, and ML-integrated pipelines. I specialize in tools that are modular, maintainable, and designed for real-world engineering needs.

I build in public and treat open source like product. Clear abstractions, practical workflows, and thoughtful code are at the core of everything I release.

Committed to scalable engineering, cross-stack execution, and building tools that empower both humans and machines.
