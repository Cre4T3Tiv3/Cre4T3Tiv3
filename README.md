# Hi, I‚Äôm Jesse Moses (@Cre4T3Tiv3)

üéØ Full-stack and AI-native builder  
üíª Deep experience in software engineering across frontend, backend, and systems  
üß† Advanced understanding of ML and model development  
üõ†Ô∏è Actively building OSS tools for modern LLM workflows and infrastructure

I‚Äôm a software engineer who builds scalable systems end to end. With over a decade of experience spanning fintech, ad-tech, and enterprise SaaS, I design and deliver production-grade software that combines deep backend architecture, rich frontend UX, and AI-native tooling.

My work includes full-stack web applications, API-first distributed systems, runtime-aware infrastructure, and ML-integrated pipelines. I specialize in building developer tools and agentic systems that are modular, maintainable, and grounded in real engineering principles.

I build in public and treat open-source like product. Clear abstractions, practical workflows, and thoughtful code are at the core of everything I release.

Committed to scalable engineering, cross-stack execution, and AI-native systems that serve both humans and machines.
